Assignment 3
- Create a "Cart & cart confirm" webpage

Overview
========
The file "Cart_"Walmart_4_TWebCartPanel.png" contains a mock-up for a Cart feature. Your assignment for Week 1 is to implement a working webpage version of this design.


Details
=======
- Focus on technologies that were hard for you in the first two weeks,most of the folks it was backbone and handlebars.
- No flat html pages ,the page should be split between reusable components 

- reuse the header and footer from Assignment1 to complete this assignment 

- Use the mockup and change the width of the page as if you are planning to build without a panel(as panel is extra credit) 

- Code should be checked in with the correct directory structure (views should be the views folder etc)  and use the right format for the JSON file .

- As with all assignments, you need to ensure the implementation adheres closely to the mock-up in a wide variety of browsers. For this assignment, consider IE 9+, Firefox 18+, and Chrome 25+ as browsers you must support.

- Don't take short-cuts on the page implementation; implement the page as you think a real production webpage should be structured.

- Demonstrate your best efforts to use front-end optimization best practices.
 
- create cookies and leverage web storage to store user preference for the cart

- None of the text should be implemented using bitmaps; real type should be used. Be thoughtful about choosing fonts that best represent the aesthetic of the design; consider using web fonts if appropriate.

- use the existing "product.json" which has all the details for a product. 

- For shipping and credit card details create mock data in a JSON file and use that on the cart confirm page.

- all the JSON files should be loaded using a server (i.e., it may take several seconds to load). This means the page should not block on loading the file and should display some indication to the user that it is loading data.

- Use Css to build buttons on the page.

- For an extra challenge, include the panel from the mockup and when a tv is added to cart from the product page ,the cart page should to reflect that on the page

- Feel free to use third-party libraries for whatever functionality you wish, but be sensitive to overall page size.
